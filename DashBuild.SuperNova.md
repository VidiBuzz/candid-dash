I've updated the Dockerfile to use a start script that replaces the port in the nginx.conf with the PORT environment variable set by Railway. The changes have been committed and pushed.

Railway will redeploy with the updated configuration. This should resolve the connection issue, as nginx will now listen on the correct port.

Once the deployment completes, your app should be accessible at the Railway URL and the custom domain.

Excellent! The deployment is successful, and your app is now live and accessible. Your Candid Studios dashboard is up and running on Railway.

The issue was that nginx was configured to listen on port 80, but Railway sets a PORT environment variable (e.g., 3000) and expects the app to listen on that port. The nginx wasn't listening on the correct port, so requests weren't reaching the app.

The fix was to use a start script that replaces the port in the nginx.conf with the PORT environment variable before starting nginx. This way, nginx listens on the port Railway expects.

You can use nginx for deployment, but you need to ensure it listens on the PORT environment variable, which is standard for Railway and other platforms.
